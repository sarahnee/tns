<p>Hi! I'm Eliza, founder and master flavor creator at Twist and Scoop! I was born and raised in central Florida and like most kids, I developed an affinity for ice cream at a very young age. From chasing after the neighborhood ice cream truck
    to helping my grandmother make home-made ice cream for family cook-outs, my love and dream only grew larger. After years of perfecting my recipes (and with the gentle nudge of friends and family) I finally turned that dream into reality and Twist and Scoop was born! 
    Beyond our delicious &mdash;frozen treats, Twist and Scoop also became a space that fostered a sense of community and joy. We take great pride at Twist and Scoop in creating an enviroment where families, friends, and neighbors can come together to share moments of happiness and creat
    lifelong memories. Thank you so much for being a part of this amazing community, we wouldn't be where we are now without all of you!<br>
